MineSweeper
===========

_"Half Hour" Minesweeper, and then all the rest..._


Quick and (hopefully) not too dirty response to a programming challenge: 
Write as much of minesweeper as you can in one half hour. Text based only 
and choose any language.
                                                                           
For speed I used Perl. In a half hour I got the bombs randomly 
placed in the playground and displayed on screen. I had started on the
number-of-nearby bombs part.
                                                                           
A few weeks later I finished it in another, maybe three hours. Not counting
whatever thinking I did in the mean time.
