MineSweeper
===========
                                                                           
####_"Half Hour" Minesweeper, and then all the rest..._
                                                                           
The classic Minesweeper game has shipped with windows forever. This is a 
"just because" version for ANSI terminal. I will not work very pleasantly
on widows in the "Command Prompt" and maybe other terminals. You will see 
the ANSI control sequences for the colored text. Look for a branch in the 
repo for a version without ANSI color if you need it.
                                                                           
####Why?
                                                                           
This is just a quick and (hopefully) not too dirty response to a 
programming challenge: # Write as much of minesweeper as you can in one
half hour. Text based only and choose any language.
                                                                          
For speed I used Perl. In a half hour I got the bombs randomly 
placed in the playground and displayed on screen. I had started on the
number-of-nearby bombs part.
                                                                          
A few weeks later I sat down and finished it. It took another, maybe three 
hours. Not counting whatever thinking I did in the mean time.
